US American Flapping Flexing Flag. A high-performance Computer Vision and Digital Signal Processing project that uses mathematical noise to transform a static image of the American flag into a procedurally animated, "pulsing" video.🚀 OverviewThis project demonstrates how to use OpenCV and NumPy to perform advanced Pixel Remapping. Instead of using traditional frame-by-frame animation, the system calculates horizontal ripples and vertical "muscle" pulses in real-time to create a unique, patriotic visual effect.Key Technical Features:Procedural Displacement Mapping: Utilizes sine-wave based noise to simulate fluid cloth physics and muscle-fiber tension.High-Precision Coordinate Warping: Implements cv2.remap with float32 accuracy to bypass standard memory alignment bottlenecks.Dynamic Lighting Simulation: A custom shimmer algorithm triggers during the "peak" of the flex to simulate light hitting shifting muscle folds.Asset Management: Includes smart-scaling logic to ensure the source asset maintains its 1280x1651 aspect ratio across cinematic widescreen outputs.🛠️ Technical StackLanguage: Python 3.13Core Libraries:OpenCV (cv2): Image processing and video encoding.NumPy: High-speed matrix math for coordinate mapping.PIL (Pillow): Initial asset handling and resizing.⚡ How It WorksThe core of the "Flex" effect is driven by a custom wave generator:$$dst(x, y) = src(map\_x(x, y), map\_y(x, y))$$The system generates a horizontal ripple effect for the "flap" and a vertical intensity pulse for the "flex," combining them into a final displacement map that is applied frame-by-frame to produce an .mp4 video.
